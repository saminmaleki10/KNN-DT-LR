# KNN/ Decision Tree/ Logistic Regression
classifying two moons dataset based on three classifies KNN, Decision Tree and Logistic Regression

# Criterias
Algorithms are applied by following these steps:

Using make_moons(n_samples=10000, noise=0.4) to generate a moons dataset.

Using train_test_split() to split the dataset into a training set and a test set (20% of data for 
test).

Using cross-validation to find good hyperparameter values for a DecisionTreeClassifier
(max_leaf_nodes), KNN (k)
